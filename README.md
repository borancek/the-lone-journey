This project was successfully undertaken during the 'Multi-Platform Game Development’ module. After four months of dedication, the project was awarded the classification of a First-Class standard, and achieved an overall score of 74.7% (Grade A). ‘The Lone Journey’ marks the entry in the series, centering around the theme of survival and the pursuit of escape from the vast island.

Central to the gameplay narrative is the presence of a concealed portal, a crucial element that demands discovery to bring the game to its conclusion. However, the portal's functionality remains dormant until its requisite components are assembled. Thus, the onus rests upon the player to undertake a thorough exploration of the expansive island terrain, seeking out and securing a total of four necessary parts. Through this endeavor, the player unlocks the potential of the portal, illuminating the path to freedom.
